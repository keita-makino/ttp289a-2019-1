The table below shows the details of the probit model which has corresponding variables to BS model used in section 5.
Overall, the coefficients and significance are similar to the logit model. (Note that, same to section 6. we have used the standard deviation $\sigma = \pi / \sqrt{3}$).

<Regression
  type={'probit'}
  data={indices.map(item => data[item])}
  input={[
    { name: 'OVERTIME', location: 0, type: 'ASV' },
    { name: 'EFACT9', location: 0, type: 'ASV' },
    { name: 'EFACT6', location: 0, type: 'ASV' },
    { name: 'MANCONST', location: 0, type: 'ASV' },
    { name: 'JOBCONST', location: 0, type: 'ASV' },

The market share based on this model was estimated as $155/333 = 46.5%$, whereas in truth it is $145/333 = 43.5%$.  
Considering the sample size of about 300, it seems fair amount of the error.

## 8.

In the last, we will develop two new models that have some additional variables or features. Those models respectively estimates the working situation (telecommuting or homecommuting) in same group of gender (male or female). We will denote the model for male group as MA model and for female group as FE model.

To compare the effect of variables, we will always include the same set of variables in both of the models.

### Hypotheses

Before selecting the variable in the models, we will go though some general assumptions in the variables.

Firstly, there should be some varibles whose coefficient will significantly differ between MA and FE model. As Mokhtarian et al. (1998) discussed, having children under six significantly have different effect on the occupation of male and female workers.
