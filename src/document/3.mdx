## 5.

The details of a logit model with the same variables referred in Mokhtarian and Salomon (1996) is shown below. We will refer to this model as Basic Model (BS Model) hereafter.

<Regression
  type={'logit'}
  data={indices.map(item => data[item])}
  input={[
    { name: 'OVERTIME', location: 0, type: 'ASV' },
    { name: 'EFACT9', location: 0, type: 'ASV' },
    { name: 'EFACT6', location: 0, type: 'ASV' },
    { name: 'MANCONST', location: 0, type: 'ASV' },
    { name: 'JOBCONST', location: 0, type: 'ASV' },
    { name: 'TECHCONS', location: 0, type: 'ASV' },
    { name: 'CSO9FT2', location: 0, type: 'ASV' }
  ]}

Looking at the outcome, there are a few variables that have been identified as non-significant due to smaller absolute of t-value. In the original paper, both number of overtime hours and technology constraint had an absolute greater than zero, which indicated that those variables were significant.

Here, the significance of a variable is computed with the following equation.

$$
\text{(p-value of coefficient } \beta \text{)} = 2 \times \Phi(-|t(\hat{\beta})|) = 2 \times \Phi\left( \frac{-|\hat{\beta}|}{SE(\hat{\beta})} \right)
$$

where $\Phi$ stands for the cumulative distribution function of standard normal distribution, $t(\hat{\beta})$ is the t-value of the corresponding coefficient, and $SE(\hat{\beta})$ is the standard error of the estimator. Note that we approximated t-distribution to normal distribution as the sample size is large enough.

The log-likelihood of this model is much larger than that of MS model shown in section 3. To test this difference is statistically significant, we can perform a Chi-Squared test, which can be written as:

$$
\begin{cases}
  H_0 \text{: There is no difference between the MS model and BS model} \\
  H_1 \text{: BS model is better}
\end{cases}
$$

The likelihood-ratio ($LR$) is

$$
LR = -2(\mathcal{BS} - \mathcal{MS})
$$

Under hypothesis $H_0$, this statistic has a chi-squared distribution with $K - 1$ (= number of variables in BS Model - 1) degree of freedom.

The log-likelihood of MS model with the same dataset (N=333) is shown below.

<Regression
  type={'logit'}
  data={indices.map(item => data[item])}
  input={[]}
  table={{ title: 'Table 3. Market Share Model' }}
/>

Thus, the statistic is:

export const PVal = x => (
  <React.Fragment>{1 - jStat.chisquare.cdf(x, 7)}</React.Fragment>
);

$$
LR = -2(\mathcal{BS} - \mathcal{MS}) = -2(-228.034 + 141.395) = 172.278
$$

$\text{(p-value)} =$<PVal x={{172.278}}/> ($<1.0e-16$)

<Regression
  type={'probit'}
  data={indices.map(item => data[item])}
  input={[
    { name: 'OVERTIME', location: 0, type: 'ASV' },
    { name: 'EFACT9', location: 0, type: 'ASV' },
    { name: 'EFACT6', location: 0, type: 'ASV' },
    { name: 'MANCONST', location: 0, type: 'ASV' },
    { name: 'JOBCONST', location: 0, type: 'ASV' },
    { name: 'TECHCONS', location: 0, type: 'ASV' },
    { name: 'CSO9FT2', location: 0, type: 'ASV' }
